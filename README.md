General Theory of Nuclear Weapons Corpus

Abstract

The General Theory of Nuclear Weapons Corpus develops the consequences of the claim established by the Special Theory of Nuclear Weapons Corpus: that nuclear weapons no longer function as discrete artifacts or individually controlled instruments, but as a single, distributed, emergent system operating across states, technologies, doctrines, and time.

Treating nuclear weapons as a corpus rather than as weapons reframes the nuclear condition as an ongoing structural field rather than an episodic event (“nuclear war”). The General Theory examines this field across five dimensions: (I) system dynamics and temporal behavior, including automation, accident, escalation, and irreversibility; (II) epistemology and expertise, addressing how knowledge, authority, and legitimacy change when the system cannot be understood piecemeal; (III) cultural and civilizational consequences, including effects on meaning, religion, myth, generation, and historical self-conception; (IV) instruments and interfaces, exploring experimental modes of engagement such as games, narrative structures, and cognitive practices; and (V) deconstruction and exit conditions, investigating how the nuclear weapons corpus might be rendered inert or exited as a historical condition without presupposing traditional disarmament models.

The General Theory does not revise the Special Theory but extends it, treating the nuclear weapons corpus as a totalizing structure that reshapes expertise, culture, and agency. Its aim is not to offer a policy prescription, but to make visible the structure of the nuclear condition itself, thereby enabling more accurate reasoning by citizens and institutions alike.

Relationship to the Special Theory

The Special Theory of Nuclear Weapons Corpus provides the formal, bounded theoretical foundation.

This repository assumes that foundation as given and does not revise it.

The Special Theory is presented separately as a sealed first-edition statement.

The General Theory begins after the Special Theory.

Structure of the General Theory

The General Theory is organized into five sections, each addressing a distinct dimension of the nuclear weapons corpus.

I. Field Dynamics

How the nuclear weapons corpus behaves as a global system over time, including automation, accident, escalation, feedback loops, latency, and irreversibility.

II. Epistemology and Expertise

How knowledge, authority, legitimacy, and expertise change when nuclear weapons operate as a distributed emergent system rather than as discrete artifacts.

III. Cultural and Civilizational Consequences

How the nuclear weapons corpus reshapes meaning, religion, myth, shame, generation, history, and civilizational self-understanding.

IV. Instruments and Interfaces

Practical and experimental interfaces with the nuclear condition, including games, LARPs, cognitive tools, narrative instruments, dreaming practices, and other non-traditional forms of engagement.

V. Deconstruction and Exit Conditions

Explorations of how the nuclear weapons corpus might be deconstructed, rendered inert, or exited as a historical condition without presupposing traditional disarmament models.

These sections are analytically distinct but interdependent.

Scope and Status

Work in this repository is in progress.

Materials may be provisional, speculative, experimental, or exploratory.
Structure, terminology, and emphasis may change as the General Theory develops.

Nothing in this repository should be read as altering the Special Theory itself.

Explanatory and Public-Facing Work

An explanatory book, Singularity of Nuclear Weapons Corpus, is being written to make the Special Theory legible to a general audience by walking through it point by point and equation by equation.

The General Theory informs that work but does not replace the formal theory.
