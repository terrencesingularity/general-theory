General Theory of Nuclear Weapons Corpus

This repository contains ongoing work toward a General Theory of Nuclear Weapons Corpus, building on the Special Theory of Nuclear Weapons Corpus (Nuclear Singularity Theory).

Where the Special Theory establishes the core structural claim — that nuclear weapons now function as a single emergent corpus rather than as discrete weapons — the General Theory develops the full field of consequences and applications that follow from that claim.

Relationship to the Special Theory

The Special Theory of Nuclear Weapons Corpus provides the formal, bounded theoretical foundation.

This repository assumes that foundation as given and does not revise it.
The Special Theory is presented separately as a sealed first-edition statement.

The General Theory begins after the Special Theory.

Structure of the General Theory

The General Theory is organized into five sections, each addressing a distinct dimension of the nuclear weapons corpus.

I. Field Dynamics

How the nuclear weapons corpus behaves as a global system over time, including automation, accident, escalation, feedback loops, latency, and irreversibility.

II. Epistemology and Expertise

How knowledge, expertise, legitimacy, and authority change when nuclear weapons operate as a distributed emergent system rather than as discrete artifacts.

III. Cultural and Civilizational Consequences

How the nuclear weapons corpus reshapes meaning, religion, myth, shame, generation, history, and civilizational self-understanding.

IV. Instruments and Interfaces

Practical and experimental interfaces with the nuclear condition, including games, LARPs, cognitive tools, narrative instruments, dreaming practices, and other non-traditional forms of engagement.

V. Deconstruction and Exit Conditions

Explorations of how the nuclear weapons corpus might be deconstructed, rendered inert, or exited as a historical condition — without assuming traditional disarmament models.

These sections are analytically distinct but interdependent.

Scope and Status

Work in this repository is in progress.

Materials may be provisional, speculative, experimental, or exploratory.
Structure, terminology, and emphasis may change as the General Theory develops.

Nothing in this repository should be read as altering the Special Theory itself.

Explanatory and Public-Facing Work

An explanatory book, Singularity of Nuclear Weapons Corpus, is being written to make the Special Theory legible to a general audience by walking through it point by point and equation by equation.

The General Theory informs that work but does not replace the formal theory.
